      <p>One of the most common "thickenings" of a point cloud that is used
      in toological data analysis is the following, because of its computational
      efficiency:</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Definition. </span>For a finite metric space \(X\),
        and a scale parameter \(r > 0\), the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex"
        target="_blank"><span class="italic">Vietoris-Rips Complex</span></a>
        (or simply, <span class="italic">VR Complex</span>), denoted by \(VR(X;r)\)
        is the complex that contains a finite simplex \(\sigma \subseteq X\)
        whenever diam\((\sigma) < r.\)</p>

        <table class="image">
        <caption align="bottom">An example VR Complex built on a point cloud.</caption>
        <tr><td><img class="centered" src="assets/RipsExample.png" align="middle" style width="50%"></td></tr>
        </table>

        <p></p>

        <p>Here we make three important remarks about VR Complexes:</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Remark 1. </span>For every scale parameter \(r \ge 0\),
        the complex \(VR(X;r)\) is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplicial_complex"
        target="_blank"><span class="italic">simplicial</span></a>. That is, it
        satisifes the properties: (1) If \(\sigma\) is in \(VR(X;r)\) and if \(\tau\) is
        in \(\sigma\), then \(\tau\) is in \(VR(X;r)\), and (2) If \(\sigma\) and \(\tau\) are in
        V\(R(X;r)\), then \(\sigma \cap \tau\) is in \(VR(X;r)\).</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Remark 2. </span>For any scale parameters \(r' \ge
        r > 0\), the natural inclusion map \(VR(X;r) \to VR(X;r')\) is a homotopy
        equivalence. That is,
        any inceasing sequence of scale parameters gives rise to an increasing
        sequence of simplicial complexes, called a <span class="italic">
        VR simplicial filtration</span>.</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Remark 3. </span>The complex \(VR(X;r)\) depends
        only on pairwise distances in \(X\). That is, \(VR(X;r)\) is equal to the
        clique complex of its 0-dimensional and 1-dimensional simplices.</p>

        <p>Remarks 1 and 2 are necessary in a technical sense because they prove
        that one can examine the persistent homology the point cloud. Remark 3
        is important because it allows us to use general tools about clique
        complexes to provide insight into VR complexes. Moreover, Remark 3 gives
        us an optimization for storing the combinatorial object \(VR(X;r)\) in a
        computer program.</p>

        <table class="image">
        <caption align="bottom">A Cech simplicial filtration of a point cloud.
        Similar to, but slightly different from, the VR simplicial filtration
        of the same point cloud.</caption>
        <tr><td><img class="centered" src="assets/CechFiltration.gif" style width="80%"></td></tr>
        </table>

        <p></p>

        <p>The importance of the VR simplicial filtration is solidified by an
        important theorem, proving that the resulting persistent homology
        barcodes from a VR simplicial filtration are "stable".</p>

        <p><span class="bold">Theorem. </span>For \(M\) a compact metric space
        and \(X \subseteq M\) a finite subspace, if \(X\) converges to \(M\) in
        the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, then \(PH(X)\) converges to \(PH(M)\) in
        the bottleneck distance.</p>

        <p>One often likes to imagine that a point cloud \(X\) was created through a
        (noisy) sampling from a manifold \(M\). However, there are very few
        infinite, continuous spaces \(M\)
        for which the barcodes \(PH(M)\) are known. Towards this end, we were
        able to compute \(PH(M)\) for \(M = P_n\) the boundary of any regular
        polygon, equipped with the Euclidean metric of the plane.</p>
