      <p>In the last two decades, there has been growing interest in analyzing
        the "shape" of data. Precisely, any collection of points in space may
        take on some shape (say, it was noisily sampled from an
        underlying manifold), and data scientists or others might gain insight
        into their data set by uncovering this shape. To accomplish this, the
        tools of topology are apt.</p>

        <p>Of course, any
        point cloud can be considered a topological space with an obvious
        discrete topology endowed, but this does lend much insight. Instead, one
        often wants to "thicken" such a space to one with a less trivial topology.
        It turns out to be difficult to do this in a canonical way, but it is
        possible if one decides to fix a given <span class="italic">scale
        parameter</span> \(r > 0\). This allows us to construct many different types
        of thickenings (e.g. Cech Complex, Vietoris-Rips Complex, Alpha
        Complex, etc.)

        <p>In the most general case, we can resolve the issue of not being able
        to choose a single canonical scale parameter by instead letting the
        scale parameter take on a range of values and studying the topology of the
        thickening at every scale. Here we can track which topological features persist
        and which die during this process. The insight is that if a feature
        persists for many values of the scale parameter, then that feature must be
        more essential to topology of the point cloud itself. This theory is known as
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistent_homology"
        target="_blank"><span class="italic">persistent homology</span></a>, and
        forms the basis for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_data_analysis"
        target="_blank"><span class="italic">topological data analysis</span></a>,

        <table class="image">
        <caption align="bottom">An example simplicial filtration of a point cloud
        and the resulting persistent homology barcodes.</caption>
        <tr><td><img class="centered" src="assets/persistentHomology.png" align="middle" style width="75%"></td></tr>
        </table>

        <p></p>

        <p>The persistence of each shape in a space \(X\) is usually described by
        the <span class="italic">persistence barcodes</span> of \(X\), denoted
        \(PH(X)\). Essentially, the barcodes track the lifetime of each topological feature, so
        one can see which features were the most important to the point cloud itself.</p>
