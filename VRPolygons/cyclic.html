  <div class="container main">
          <p>A major result of previous work is that the homotopy type of the
          clique complex of any <span class="italic">cyclic graph</span> depends
          only on its <span class="italic">winding fraction</span>. These
          details can be understood in the following informal manner:</p>

          <p><span class="bold">Definition. </span>A directed graph \(G\) is
          <span class="italic">cyclic</span> if its vertices can be placed in a
          cyclic order such that, whenever there is an edge \(u \to w\), then
          there are also edges \(u \to v \to w\) for all \(u \prec v \prec w\).</p>

          <p><span class="bold">Definition. </span>For a cyclic graph \(G\) and
          a vertex \(v\), define \(f(v)\) to be the clockwise-most vertex \(w\)
          such that there exists an edge \(v\to w\). Then the <span class="italic">
          winding fraction</span> of \(G\) is</p>

          \[ \mbox{wf}(G) = \sup\bigg\{\frac{\omega}{k}\bigg\}\]

          where the ratio \(\omega/k\) is realized by an \(f\)-periodic orbit with
          length \(k\) which "winds" \(\omega\) times around its center, and the
          \(\sup\) is taken over all \(f\)-periodic orbits in \(G\).</p>

          <table class="image">
          <caption align="bottom">A (finite) cyclic graph of winding fraction \(1/4\).</caption>
          <tr><td><img class="centered" src="assets/cyclicGraph.png" align="middle" style width="50%"></td></tr>
          </table>

          <p></p>

          <p><span class="bold">Definition. </span>A cyclic graph is called
          <span class="italic">metric</span> if its vertex set can be given a
          metric \(d\) such that \(u \prec v \prec w\) implies \(d(u,v)< d(u,w)\).</p>

          <p>For technical reasons, metric cyclic graphs behave much more nicely
          than mere cyclic graphs. Indeed, the existence of the nearly monotone metric
          guarantees that certain \(f\)-periodic orbits unique, many functions
          from \(G\) into \(\mathbb{R}\) are continuous, etc. While we omit these
          details for brevity's sake, a main contribution of this project was
          the development of this general theory of metric cyclic graphs.</p>

          <p>All this in mind, we are able to reduce this topological task to a
          purely geometric one: When are (metric) cyclic graphs supported in \(P_n\)
          and how does the winding fraction change over these regimes?</p>
