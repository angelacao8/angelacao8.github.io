        <p><span class="italic">Abstract. </span>Persistent homology has emerged
          as a novel tool for data analysis in the past two decades. However,
          there are still very few shapes or even manifolds whose persistent
          homology barcodes (say of the Vietoris--Rips complex) are fully known.
          Towards this direction, let \(P_n\) be the boundary of a regular polygon
          in the plane with \(n\) sides; we describe the homotopy types of
          Vietoris--Rips complexes of \(P_n\). Indeed, when \(n=(k+1)!!\) is an odd
          double factorial, we provide a complete characterization of the homotopy
          types and persistent homology of the Vietoris--Rips complexes of \(P_n\)
          up to a scale parameter \(r_n\), where \(r_n\) approaches the diameter of
          \(P_n\) as \(n\to\infty\). Surprisingly, these homotopy types include spheres
          of all dimensions. Roughly speaking, the number of higher-dimensional
          spheres appearing is linked to the number of equilateral (but not
          necessarily equiangular) stars that can be inscribed into \(P_n\). As our
          main tool we use the recently-developed theory of cyclic graphs and
          winding fractions. Furthermore, we show that the Vietoris--Rips complex
          of an arbitrarily dense subset of \(P_n\) need not be homotopy equivalent
          to the Vietoris--Rips complex of \(P_n\) itself, and indeed, these two
          complexes can have different homology groups in arbitrarily high dimensions.
          As an application of our results, we provide a lower bound on the
          Gromov--Hausdorff distance between \(P_n\) and the circle.</p>

        by the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics
        ("ICERM") and Brown University.</p>
