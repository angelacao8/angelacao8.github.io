        <p> I recently found myself studying the stochastic differential
          equation (SDE) \(dX_t = \cos(\pi t)dt + \sin(\pi t X_t)dB_t\) with
          \(X_0 = 0\). While no explicit solutions exist, I predicted
          the following interesting qualitative behavior: The noise term
          should have only a weak effect on the system whenever
          \(\sin(\pi t X_t)\approx 0\), i.e. whenever \(X_t\approx k/t\)
          for \(k\in\mathbb{N}\). In other words, I expected that any
          sample path which goes near one of these hyperbolas should
          stay near the curve until a sufficiently large random force
          knocks it away. I came across the image above while checking
          this behavior computationally by
          simulating 1000 sample paths of solutions to the SDE using the
          Milstein scheme.

        <p> In an introductory graph theory class we proved that
          any closed curve in the plane whose tangents have at
          most finitely many self-intersections gives rise to a 2-colorable
          partition of the plane. The image above is my chalkboard realization
          of 2 such curves (red and purple) and their respective colorings
          (blue and yellow) along with the regions colored by both (green).

        <p> In <i>Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Regular Polygons</i>, we proved that
          \(n \ge 4\ell + 2\) is a necessary and sufficient condition for
          every point on the boundary of the regular polygon \(P_n\) to be
          contained in a unique \((2\ell+1)\)-pointed star whose vertices
          also lie on the boundary of \(P_n\). Furthermore, we proved that the stars of
          maximal side length are those containing a vertex of \(P_n\) and that the
          stars of minimal side length are those containing a midpoint of an
          edge of \(P_n\). The following image realizes \(P_{11}\) (black)
          along with its minimal (blue) and maximal (green) inscribed 5-pointed stars.
